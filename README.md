# Bayesian Optimization API 🚀

## Overview ℹ️
Welcome to my Bayesian Optimization API! I created this mini-project to enhance my understanding of bayesian optimization whilst exploring some API deployment. 

## Purpose 🎯
The API provides an interactive platform for users to explore Bayesian optimization. Users can experiment with different objective functions, kernel types, and hyperparameters to understand how Bayesian optimization works in practice.

## API Demo - Click to see Streamlit Project Page 💻

## Features 🛠️
- **Interactive Interface:** Input your objective function and specify the optimization domain.
- **Kernel Selection:** Choose from various kernel types like RBF, Matern, etc.
- **Kernel Hyperparameters:** Adjust additional hyperparameters for fine-tuning.
- **Visualizations:** View initial and final surrogate models with confidence intervals.

## Installation 🚀
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Streamlit app: `streamlit run main.py`.
